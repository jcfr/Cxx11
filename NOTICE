Most of the code snippets in this directory were taken from the book

     "The C++ Programming Language"
     4th Edition

     Bjarne Stroustup

You will find versions closer to the original at

     http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html

The versions in this current repository have been reworked with minor
retouches, mostly intended to help me understand the examples.

Any errors are definitely and most certainly mine.  :-)

Suggestions on how to improve the examples will be greately appreciated.

I would like to convert this into a tutorial on C++11 for C++98 developers.
